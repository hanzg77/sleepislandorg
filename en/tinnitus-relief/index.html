    <h1>Tinnitus Relief: Find Quiet with Natural Sounds</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Cricket Sounds &middot; Insect Ambience &middot; Sound Masking Therapy</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>If you have tinnitus, you know the feeling: during the day it's manageable, but the moment things get quiet at night, the buzzing and hissing in your ears becomes impossible to ignore.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. About 15% of people worldwide experience tinnitus, and many of them struggle to fall asleep because of it.</p>

        <h2>What Is Sound Masking Therapy?</h2>
        <p>Sound masking is one of the most widely recognized non-drug treatments for tinnitus. The principle is simple: use external sounds to "cover up" the tinnitus, so your brain stops focusing on it.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>According to Mayo Clinic:</strong> "Sound therapy is our primary tool for helping ease tinnitus distress. White noise machines, nature sounds, or low-volume music can help reduce the perception of tinnitus."
        </div>

        <h2>Why Cricket Sounds Work So Well</h2>
        <p>Many tinnitus sufferers describe their tinnitus as sounding like crickets &mdash; high-pitched, continuous, rhythmic. Research has found that using white noise with frequency characteristics similar to the tinnitus tone provides the best masking effect.</p>

        <p>That's why cricket sounds and summer night insect ambience are particularly effective for many tinnitus sufferers:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 24px; color: #8b95b0;">
            <li>Frequency range matches common tinnitus tones (2,000-6,000 Hz)</li>
            <li>Natural rhythmic variation prevents auditory fatigue</li>
            <li>More comfortable than mechanical white noise for extended listening</li>
            <li>Also helps with falling asleep</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sleep Island's Tinnitus Relief Sounds</h2>
        <p>Sleep Island includes a variety of natural sounds suited for tinnitus relief:</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What white noise is best for tinnitus?</h3>
            <p>Try sounds with frequencies close to your tinnitus tone. High-pitched tinnitus (like crickets or cicadas) responds well to cricket sounds and insect ambience. Low-pitched tinnitus (like humming) may be better masked with ocean waves or deep sea white noise. Experiment to find what works for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can sound masking therapy cure tinnitus?</h3>
            <p>Sound therapy can't cure tinnitus, but it effectively reduces discomfort and helps with falling asleep. It's recommended by Mayo Clinic and other leading medical institutions. If your tinnitus worsens or you experience hearing loss, see a doctor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is it safe to sleep with white noise?</h3>
            <p>At reasonable volumes (below 60 decibels), it's completely safe. Sleep Island supports auto-off timers. Keep the volume just loud enough to mask your tinnitus.</p>
